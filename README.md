# Task-4
This project implements logistic regression to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset. It includes data preprocessing steps such as removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and encoding the target variable. The features are standardized, and the data is split into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using a confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and AUC score. The project also demonstrates threshold tuning and visualizes the sigmoid function. It provides a complete workflow for binary classification using logistic regression in a clear and practical manner.
